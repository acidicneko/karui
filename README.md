# Simple C Build (scbuild) Tool
There are tools like CMake, Ninja, make etc. but they are not as simple, but complex in nature for a relatively simpler project.

scbuild aims to be easy to use and fast. Note that it is not a replacement for CMake or Ninja, but just a simple build tool for small projects.
It supports both C and C++.


> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is still in development and is not meant to be used in production.
> Currently, it is configured to compile itself only.

## Features
- Simple to use
- fast
- Recompile only on changes

## Future plans
- Add a configuring the tool via a config file
- File exclusions

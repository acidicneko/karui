# Simple C Build (scbuild) Tool
Almost all languages have some dedicated build tools, but C/C++ doesn't. There are tools like CMake, Ninja, make etc. but they are not as simple as they should be. This tool is a simple build tool for C/C++ projects.

scbuild aims to be easy to use and fast. Note that it is not a replacement for CMake or Ninja, but a simple build tool for small projects.

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is still in development and is not meant to be used in production.
> Currently, it is configured to compile itself only.

## Features
- Simple to use
- fast
- Recompile only on changes

## Future plans
- Add a configuring the tool via a config file
- File exclusions
